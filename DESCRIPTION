Description: The scDiagnostics package provides diagnostic plots to assess the quality of cell type assignments 
             from single cell gene expression profiles. The implemented functionality allows to assess the reliability of
             cell type annotations, investigate gene expression patterns, and explore relationships between different cell types
             in query and reference datasets allowing users to detect potential misalignments between reference and query datasets.
