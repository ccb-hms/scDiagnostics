\title{Extract Gene Order from ComplexHeatmap Object}
\usage{
extractGeneOrder(heatmap_object)
}
\arguments{
\item{heatmap_object}{A ComplexHeatmap Heatmap object (undrawn or drawn).}
}
\value{
A character vector of gene names in the clustered order (top to bottom as they appear in heatmap).
}
\description{
Extracts the hierarchically clustered gene order from a ComplexHeatmap Heatmap object.
}
\details{
This function initializes a ComplexHeatmap object (without displaying it) to perform
hierarchical clustering, then extracts the resulting gene order. This allows matching
gene ordering between heatmap and other plot types. The function uses a null graphics
device to initialize the heatmap clustering without actually drawing the plot.
